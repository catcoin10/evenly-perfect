Factorization of perfect numbers


This is a long-term project which my computer is engaged in. What the purpose of the project is is to experiment with perfect numbers. A perfect number is simply a number that. Every perfect number (as far as we know) is derived from a Mersenne prime. 

This perfect number has a lot of 2's in it. In fact, the number of twos in the prime factorization is equal to the exponent of the Mersenne prime number. So, what is interesting is taking the twos out of the number. When we do this, we get a big number with lots and lots of factors. We need ALL of the factors in order to recreate the perfect number.

What I like about perfect numbers is that they are shadows of Mersenne primes. They were discovered in antiquity by the ancient Greeks. They have many factors, which is the opposite of Mersenne primes.
